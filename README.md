    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    
        Making sure that your code is secure means making sure that you try to account for as many use-cases as possible, and only allow editing or deleting of objects when needed. To make sure the code is functional, thorough testing and code coverage percentage checks are necessary.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    
        Program requirements documents are the best tool that a software developer has in terms of getting the user's needs worked into a program. Every item in a requirements document can usually be translated into code. Some features that the user/customer is looking for will be fields in a class, and other features will end up being a method that is in a class or somewhere else in the program.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    
        I try to follow the requirements document very closely. I base my program features off of the individual needs listed in the requirements document. Starting with those simple buidling blocks allows me to plan the program as a whole a lot more easily.
